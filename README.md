graphql-grpc-edge
===================

This repo is an experimental work to automatically generate graphql server
as aggregate server to serve gRPC backed service.

1. Background

gRPC and GraphQL are application level communication protocol designed to solve different set of problems. Both gRPC and GraphQL using different serialization and specification but shares same characteristics and functionalities as listed below.

Same specification characteristics between protobuf to grphql schema:

 Protobuf   | GraphQL
--------------------------------------------------------
 Package    | N/A
 Service    | N/A
 Import     | N/A
 Enum       | Enum
 Oneof      | Union
 Message    | Type
 Field      | Field
 RPC        | `Query` or `Mutation`
 RPC Input  | `InputObject` with `option (graphql.type)`
 RPC Output | `Object` with `option (graphql.type)`

Same primitive serialization data types:

 Protobuf | GraphQL
---------------------
 uint8    | Int
 uint16   | Int
 uint32   | Int
 uint64   | Int
 int8     | Int
 int16    | Int
 int32    | Int
 int64    | Int
 float32  | Float
 float64  | Float
 string   | String
 bool     | Boolean

2. Goals

Create a tool to get the best of both worlds. gRPC is very helpful to develop backend service. With gRPC, API contracts can be described concisely and also code implementation can be autogenerated. Unfortunately, as of this repository is created, there is no easy way to use gRPC directly from web browsers for web application. On the otherhand, GraphQL is very popular on web frontend community thanks to its flexible query fields resulting in efficient network transfer size, and graph-like data representation very helpful for frontend engineer. One of the downsize of using GraphQL is there's no easy way to generate a GraphQL schema.

It is possible to create a GraphQL server and schema to be used by frontend engineer while communicating to backend services using gRPC to return the results. But to do this manually will be very tedious.
